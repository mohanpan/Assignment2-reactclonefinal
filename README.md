# Assign2-ReactClone

by Mohan Pan November 19th, 2021

The website that I chose is IKEA, because I am planning to do my own website and wanted to add a page for shopping features. IKEA has the clear style and well planned design that I am aimming for, so I picked IKEA over Amazon and Walmart.

I made the Homepage, Shop page (click on main menu at the left top, then it shows you 4 sections: Shop page, and the other 3.) and the search page (so the search button works).
